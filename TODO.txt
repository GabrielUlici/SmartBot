############ What still needs to be done. ############
########## - not in any particular order  - ##########

############ App features ###########

- create an icon for the app.
- fix the splash screen - the image is to big -
- add actionbarsherlok in the app so it will be
	compatible with older models.
- organize better the classes - because it is a mess.
- create landscape layouts and for small screens.
- optimize for tablets.
- make it more interactive like a dialog between the user and the robot
- install the behaviors if they are not present.
- use terminal if there is no connection to the robot
	// long press on the robot name to display a menu.
- send a command when i connect and sends me back an ok or not ok.
- add a PullToRefresh to find new robots.
- control more robots at the same time. multi-robot.
- to work even on other robots not only the NAO robot
- remember the last 2-5 robots that we connected to and display them as online or offline
- when we cannot establish a connection with the robot - change the actionbar
			 or the name of the robot background with error_robot_texture.png 

############ App Commands ###########

- What can you do
- Nao telling a joke
- dialog
- set volume - command "What did you say" or " i cannot hear you" it will 
				raise the volume and say "Can you hear me now". 
			- command "raise your volume"
- say word
- you are impressive
- good bye

############ App Settings ###########

- language.
- theme.
- wallpapers.

############ App Speech ###########

- Using ontology with speech.
- add in the if to check even for the var OK because
	when the while starts and the string is in two
	if's then both are going to be executed.

############ App Buttons ###########

- create icons for the tabs.
- change the color of the tabs.
